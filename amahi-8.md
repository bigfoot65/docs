title: Install Amahi 8
---

Welcome to to the **Amahi 8** release!

There are some ways to get Amahi 8 up and running. The best and recommended way is installing from scratch.

However, we also list some alternative options below.

# Installing from Scratch

Installing Amahi 8 fresh is the recommended way to install. It requires the installation of Fedora 21 first. Then Amahi 8 proper. After that is done, you should transition your network devices to using Amahi!

Only 64-bit systems are supported. We do not plan to support 32-bit systems.

Follow the [directions to install Amahi 8](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_8_Install).

# Upgrading Amahi 7 to Amahi 8

Upgrading from an existing 64-bit (_not_ 32-bit) Amahi 7 running system is supported **to a limited extent**.

We have tested this installation path with a fair bit of success, with clean versions and fully-updated versions of Amahi 7. If your system is somewhat modified, it **may not upgrade well**. We cannot possibly support all system hardware/sw configurations. We recommend uninstalling as many apps as possible and reinstalling them after the upgrade to Amahi 8.

Visit the [Amahi 7 to Amahi 8](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_8_Upgrade) install guide.

Upgrading from Amahi 6 is not supported.

# Unsupported Methods

We have tried a few [unsupported ways to install Amahi 8](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_8_install_via_unsupported_methods). Only use them when all else fails.

These include [USB install](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/USB_Install), [Workstation (DVD) Install](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Fedora_21_Live_Workstation_Install) and [LXDE (CD) Install](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Fedora_21_Live_LXDE_Install).
