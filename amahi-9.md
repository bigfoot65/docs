title: Install Amahi 9
---

Welcome to to the **Amahi 9** release!

There are some ways to get Amahi 9 up and running. The best and recommended way is installing from scratch.

However, we also list some alternative options below.

# Installing from Scratch

Installing Amahi 9 fresh is the recommended way to install. It requires the installation of Fedora 23 first. Then Amahi 9 proper. After that is done, you should transition your network devices to using Amahi!

Only 64-bit systems are supported. We do not plan to support 32-bit systems.

Follow the [directions to install Amahi 9](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_9_Install).

# Upgrading Amahi 8 to Amahi 9

Upgrading from an existing 64-bit (_not_ 32-bit) Amahi 8 running system is supported **to a limited extent**.

We have tested this installation path with a fair bit of success, with clean versions and fully-updated versions of Amahi 7. If your system is somewhat modified, it **may not upgrade well**. We cannot possibly support all system hardware/sw configurations. We recommend uninstalling as many apps as possible and reinstalling them after the upgrade to Amahi 8.

Visit the [Amahi 8 to Amahi 9](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_9_Upgrade) install guide.

Upgrading from Amahi 7 is not supported, though it may work, if you try it via the OS. Upgrading from Amahi 6 is definitely not possible.
